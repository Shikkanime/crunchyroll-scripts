# crunchyroll-scripts
A collection of handy bash scripts to simplify some interactions with Crunchyroll.

### â†’ [apk-credentials-extract](./apk-credentials-extract.sh)
Extracts client id & client secret from a Crunchyroll App APK. You can either dump an apk from your own device or use a website like [apkmirror.com](https://www.apkmirror.com) to download them.

<sub>Inspired from [vitalygashkov/crextractor](https://github.com/vitalygashkov/crextractor), but more lightweight and without needing a whole JS runtime.</sub>
